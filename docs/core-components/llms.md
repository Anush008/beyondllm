# ðŸ§  LLMs

## What is LLMs aka Large Language Models?

An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a fundamental element of BeyondLLM. It is used in the generate function to generate a response. We support a variety of models including `ChatOpenAI`, `Gemini`, `HuggingFaceHub Models`, `AzureChatOpenAI` and `Ollama` wrapper.

### GeminiModel

Gemini is the default model used in BeyondLLM. This model includes the Gemini family models from Google.

_Notes: Currently we only support **gemini-pro** and **gemini-1.0-pro. Also no need to install Google Generative AI, because this is a default model.**_&#x20;

**Parameters**

* **Google API Key** : Key used to authenticate and access the Gemini API. Get API key from here: [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)
* **Model Name :** Defines the Gemini chat model to be used in eg: _**gemini-pro**_

**Code snippet**

```python
from beyondllm.llms import GeminiModel

llm = GeminiModel(model_name="gemini-pro",google_api_key = "<your_api_key>")
print(llm.predict("<your-query>"))
```

Import the GeminiModel from the llms and configure it according to your needs and start using it.

### GPT-4o Multimodal Model

This LLM, GPT4OpenAIModel, harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities, enabling interactions that go beyond simple text. It seamlessly handles image, audio, and video inputs alongside text prompts, opening up a realm of multimodal possibilities within your BeyondLLM applications.

In order to harness the multi-modal capabilities of this model, make sure to install the below libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python moviepy
```

**Parameters:**

* **api\_key** (required): Your OpenAI API key. You can find this key on your OpenAI account page.
* **model** (optional): Specifies the GPT-4 model to use. The default is "gpt-4o," which is GPT-4 with vision capabilities.
* **model\_kwargs** (optional): A dictionary of additional keyword arguments to pass to the OpenAI API call, such as max\_tokens (to control response length) or temperature (to influence the randomness of the output).
* **media\_paths** (optional): The path or a list of paths to your multimedia files (images, audio, or video). You can pass either a single string representing a file path or a list of strings for multiple files. Supported formats include:
  * **Images:** JPG, PNG
  * **Audio:** MP3, WAV
  * **Video:** MP4, AVI, WEBM

**Code Snippet:**

```python
from beyondllm.llms import GPT4oOpenAIModel

# Initialize the GPT4OpenAIModel with your API key
llm = GPT4oOpenAIModel(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
```

**Example Usages:**

**1. Using a Single Image:**

```python
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
response = llm.predict("What can you tell me about this image?", media_paths=image_path)
print(response)
```

**2. Using Multiple Media Files:**

```python
media_paths = ["path/to/image.png", "path/to/audio.mp3", "path/to/video.mp4"]
response = llm.predict("Summarize the content of these files", media_paths=media_paths)
print(response)
```

**NOTE**: Whisper will be used for Audio to Text transcription

BeyondLLM allows you to easily incorporate GPT-4's multimodal abilities into your projects without having to manage the complexities of media encoding and transcription

The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and 150k demo apps (Spaces), all open source and publicly available, in an online platform where people can easily collaborate and build ML together.

**Installation**

In order to use HuggingFaceModel, we first need to install it:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

### GroqModel

Groq, a powerful language model API offering access to various chat models, excels at delivering exceptional speed, quality, and energy efficiency compared to traditional methods. If faster LLM inference is a priority, Groq is an excellent choice.

**Installation**

In order to use GroqModel, we first need to install it:

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python">pip <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">install</a> groq
</code></pre>

**Parameters**

* **Groq API Key**: Obtain your Groq API key from the Groq console ([https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)) and set it up as an environment variable for security. This key authenticates your requests with the Groq API.
* **Model** (Required):Specifies the Groq language model to use.&#x20;
* **Optional Parameters**:
  * temperature: Controls the response randomness (lower for predictable, higher for creative).

#### &#x20;   Code Snippet

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'] = getpass("Enter your Groq API key securely: ")
from beyondllm.llms import GroqModel

llm = GroqModel(
    model_name=model,
    groq_api_key=os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY'),
    temperature=0 )

```

This code retrieves your Groq API key securely, creates a GroqModel instance with the specified model\_name and retrieved API key, sets an optional temperature parameter, and demonstrates how to use the generate method for text generation. Remember to replace model with the actual Groq model name you want to use.
